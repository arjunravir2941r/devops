Documentation for passing environment variables from S3 buckets to containers (admin, ws and central) in the AWS ECS Task Definition.

FYI: Currently all the environment variable files are in GitLab and should be uploaded to s3 buckets for task definition to use.

To specify different environment variable files for each container in an AWS ECS Task Definition, we would include the environmentFiles parameter within each container's definition in the task definition. Here's a general approach:

Prepare Different Environment Files: Ensure we have separate .env files for each container, stored in Amazon S3.

Task Definition: In the task definition JSON, under containerDefinitions, specify the environmentFiles for each container individually.

Deploy Task Definition: Use this task definition to launch our ECS tasks. Each container will pull its specific environment variables from the designated S3 file.

Remember to ensure that the task execution role has the necessary permissions to access these S3 files. Each .env file must adhere to the formatting requirements mentioned earlier.

JSON format : 



{
  "family": "your-task-family",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "container1",
      "image": "image-for-container1",
      "environmentFiles": [
        {
          "value": "arn:aws:s3:::s3_bucket_name/container1.env",
          "type": "s3"
        }
      ]
      ...
    },
    {
      "name": "container2",
      "image": "image-for-container2",
      "environmentFiles": [
        {
          "value": "arn:aws:s3:::s3_bucket_name/container2.env",
          "type": "s3"
        }
      ]
      ...
    }
    // Repeat for other containers
  ]
}
