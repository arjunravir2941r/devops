With mutual authentication, Client VPN uses certificates to perform authentication between the client and the server. Certificates are a digital form of identification issued by a certificate authority (CA). The server uses client certificates to authenticate clients when they attempt to connect to the Client VPN endpoint. You must create a server certificate and key, and at least one client certificate and key.

Install AWS cli over the machine where you created the certificates to upload the certificate to certificate manager in AWS
